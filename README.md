# Brick_Breaker

Developed a fully functional brick breaker game using Java on the eclipse IDE 
by programming functions that allow the interaction between the computer, the mouse, and keyboard.
Utilized several Java packages such as the JFrame packages, that was used to create a 
Graphical User Interface (GUI) so the game can be displayed for the user to interact with 
and maximize user satisfaction.
